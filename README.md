## Services

### Firebase

The service __firebase.js__ provides the functions needed to interact with Cloud Firestore in order to obtain information from the database.
In order to use the firebase service you need to provide your own credentials in an .env file. The format of this file is left in the .env.example file of the repository.

- __getDocuments__:
    
    Function that brings information from the database. It receives five parameters:
        
        -col (string): name of the collection that provides the information.
        -isOneItem (boolean): true if you want to get only one document form database, false if you want to get more than one item.
        -filter (string or boolean): if you want to filter the documents, provide a string that will work as the parameter from the database that you want to compare against your variable. In case you don't need to filter, provide false.
        -operator(string or boolean): provide the operator that will compare the filter with the variable. In case you don't need to filter, provide false.
        -compareTo(string or boolean): provide the variable that will be compared with the filter. In case you don't need to filter, provide false.

- __createOrder__:

    Function that allows the Cart Component to create an order in the database. It receives five parameters:

        -name (string): name of the buyer.
        -phone (number) : phone of the buyer.
        -email (string) : email of the buyer.
        -products (object) : products in the cart.
        -totalPrice (number) : total price of the products.


*To use this service you will need to store your own firebase credentials in the .env file to access the database (a .env example file is available in the repository to serve as a guide for this).*

## Contexts

### CartContext

The context __cartContext.js__ provides several functions to allow the user to buy products.

- __isInCart__: function that receives the parameter 'id' with the type string. It allows the Cart component to know if the item selected by the user is already in the cart.
- __removeItem__: function that receives the parameter 'itemId' with the type string. It allows the user to remove an item from the cart.
- __clear__: function that doesn't receive any parameters and allows the user to remove all elements from the cart.
- __getTotal__: function that doesn't receive any parameters and allows the Cart component to obtain the total price of the items in the cart.
- __addItem__ : function that receives the parameter item as an object, and stores that item in the cart items.
- __saveOrder__: function that allows the user to send the order to the database. It receives three parameters that the user provides through the component CartForm:

        -name (string) : name and lastname of the user.
        -phone (number) : telephone number of the user.
        -email (string) : email of the user.

It also provides variables:

-__cartItems__ : array that stores the items that the user wants to buy.
